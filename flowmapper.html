 <p class="card-text">Analyzing the spatial distribution of information upon the map offers many different aspects to 
focus on. One can look at individual variable distribution and then the combination of them all in 
the entire map. Beginning with focusing on the Net Dispersal of Family Heritage, which is 
displayed as a choropleth map, the most prevalent and extreme classifications are within the 
midwestern US, with the extreme negative classification for Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, and the 
extreme positive distribution to be Oklahoma. Further, higher trends of negative classifications 
are upon the east coast, and positive upon the west. The higher extremes of both classifications 
are relatively clustered towards the middle of the US. Focusing of the nods, which represent the 
total events of dispersal, it shows three main extremes of high events, within Texas, Oklahoma, 
and Missouri. Specifically, Missouri and Oklahoma make sense due to the choropleth map, but 
Texas surprised me as it has a low, positive net dispersal classification. Florida, which the net 
dispersal was considered neutral, had the lowest total event classification, which makes intuitive 
sense. The flow patterns display the complexity of the system, but not to the point of confusion, 
but most extremely, high counts are mapped going both ways from Texas and Oklahoma. 
Viewing and analyzing the map as a whole, I am most drawn to the intensity of 
classifications, for all variables, clustered within the middle of the US. It provides insightful 
information revolving around the high rate of dispersal within those states in comparison to other 
states of the contagious US. Itâ€™s helpful to immediately observe the extent of the net dispersal, 
and then contextualize the number of events that occurred in each state, and then additionally 
displaying where they go. I think all the variables combined upon a singular map, while at first 
can be intimidating and slightly overwhelming, once a basis of understanding what is being 
displayed, it almost creates a story like display of the data.
